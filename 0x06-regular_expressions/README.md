0x06. Regular expression

Background Context

For this project, you have to build your regular expression using Oniguruma, a regular expression library that which is used by Ruby by default. Note that other regular expression libraries sometimes have different properties.



Because the focus of this exercise is to play with regular expressions (regex), here is the Ruby code that you should use, just replace the regexp part, meaning the code in between the //:

Requirements

General

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

All your Bash script files must be executable

The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env ruby

All your regex must be built for the Oniguruma library.

6. This task is brought to you by a professional advisor Neha Jain, Senior Software Engineer at LinkedIn.



Requirement:



The regular expression must match a 10 digit phone number

7. Requirement:

8. This exercise was prepared for you by Guillaume Plessis, VP of Infrastructure at TextMe. It is something he uses daily. You can thank Guillaume for his project on Twitter.



For this task, you’ll be taking over Guillaume’s responsibilities: one afternoon, a TextMe VoIP Engineer comes to you and explains she wants to run some statistics on the TextMe app text messages transactions.



Requirements:



Your script should output: [SENDER],[RECEIVER],[FLAGS]

The sender phone number or name (including country code if present)

The receiver phone number or name (including country code if present)

The flags that were used

You can find a [log file here].
